            <p>For the past 11 years Contented Puppies Paradise was located on a small farm¬†approximately five miles outside the town of Dade City, Florida. We were blessed to offer our children the wholesome experience of growing up on a farm surrounded by beautiful puppies.</p>
            <p>While we enjoy raising puppies very much - our hearts are also drawn to helping families in Honduras¬†who are experiencing extreme poverty, in particular; widows and orphans. We are the founders of House of Hope, a ministry dedicated to providing homes for those in desperate need. As House of Hope grew it became clear that we would no longer be able to raise puppies full time. As a result, we have moved all our puppies to El Dorado Springs, Missouri. Nestled in the heart of the Ozarks, our puppies are now cared for by my sister Jan and her family, along with our parents. You can be assured they will continue to provide the same outstanding service our customers are accustomed to receiving.</p>

            <p>This puppy is guaranteed for its first full year of life against life-threatening, congenital anomalies, for¬†example: liver stent, hip dysplasia, or a defective heart. If this puppy develops such a congenital anomaly within the first year of life, I will replace the puppy with a male / female of equal value.

            <p><strong>Many people come across our website when looking for local breeders,</strong>¬†and it‚Äôs easy to understand why. A puppy is a major purchase, and a yorkie or morkie pup can be tricky to take care of in the beginning. You want to know that you haven‚Äôt given your money to someone who is going to simply vanish when you need them most. There are also concerns of how you would actually get your new puppy from a breeder who is potentially hundreds or thousands of miles away.</p>
            <p><strong>We understand these concerns.</strong>¬†One look at¬†<a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Contented-Puppies-Paradise/227044703979468"><strong>our Facebook page</strong></a>¬†will give you a peek into the Contented Puppies family.<strong>¬†We‚Äôre never more than a click or phone call away,</strong>¬†and we care that our puppies are well taken care of after they leave our home and go to yours. Our goal isn‚Äôt to just sell you a puppy, it‚Äôs to bring you the best experience possible, and¬†<strong>we are here to work with you every step of the way.</strong><strong>We are proud of our record with customers,</strong>¬†and the rate at which they return to us for their second, third, or even FOURTH puppies is a testament to that. If you look more closely at our Facebook page, you will see many contented owners who are planning another purchase, or who just hang around to give advice and ask questions.¬†<strong>When you buy a Contented Puppy, you are getting much more than a furry companion‚Ä¶</strong>¬†You are joining a group of yorkie and morkie parents all across the country.</p>
            <p><strong>So, while we may not be right down the road from you,</strong>¬†we are absolutely¬†always¬†available, willing, and able to make sure both you and your puppy have many fun-filled days together!</p>
            <h3>For our customers in remote locations:</h3>
            <p><strong>If you live far from our home,</strong>¬†you may be wondering how you would obtain your little bundle of fur after making a purchase.¬†<strong>We have handled deliveries for families living in all four corners of the USA,</strong>¬†and go to great pains to ensure the comfort of your new puppy, and the ease with which you can pick them up.<strong>While the best way to get your puppy is to take a trip to our home and pick them up in your own arms,</strong>¬†here is how the process works when we have a customer who can‚Äôt make the trip to us.</p>
            <p><strong>1. You pick the perfect puppy for your family</strong>¬†by looking through as many photos and videos as you can handle, and of course by speaking with us¬†<strong>on the phone</strong>!</p>
            <p><strong>2. Once you have made your selection,</strong>¬†and we are sure it‚Äôs a good match, you go ahead and put a deposit on the puppy.</p>
            <p><strong>3. We send you a contract which guarantees the puppy‚Äôs health</strong>¬†and that the shots are up to date.¬†<em>(Every puppy is sold with a 1-year health guarantee.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>4. You sign the contract,</strong>¬†agreeing to the terms and conditions, and send it back to us.</p>

          <h2 class="information-header">The Truth About Teacup/Pocket Puppies</h2>
          <p class="information-text">Buyers should beware that¬†there is no such dog as &quot;teacup&quot; or &quot;pocket&quot; Yorkie. These are simply terms that certain breeders may use to increase interest in their dogs, and sometimes the price. Some Yorkie and Maltese puppies are smaller than others, but the preferred standard weight recommended by the AKC is between four and five pounds.</p>
          <p class="information-text">The following quote was made by Daryl Martin, a breeder of Maltese puppies in Highland Park, Illinois.</p>
          <blockquote>&quot;There is no such thing as a teacup Maltese, the whole teacup phenomenon is a horrible thing because the breed is already small. And the tiny ones tend to have many health problems, from water in the brain to liver shunts, (abnormal veins that result in failure of the liver to metabolize toxins and brain inflammation.)&quot;</blockquote>
          <p class="information-text">Ingela Gram a breeder and AKC licensed judge of West Redding, Connecticut is quoted as saying, &quot;You will pay a lot of veterinarian bills,&quot; and she further adds that the so called &quot;Teacup Maltese&quot; often have the Chihuaha-esque, apple domed skull and open fontanel, a skull shape that isn&#x27;t conformationally correct for the Maltese. &quot;They usually are not healthy and have many problems.&quot; &quot;When you get a dog down to two pounds, nothing develops like it should. The heart is small, the liver is small. Do you want to end up going to the vet all the time?&quot; Ingela further adds that, &quot;You wouldn&#x27;t see a so-called &quot;Teacup Maltese&quot; in the show ring, because this super-small-sized Maltese weighing below the preferred minimum of four pounds is often associated with incorrect conformation, such as a skull that is too apple-domed.&quot;<br><br>A Maltese may occasionally be born small, but a tiny size is no advantage, agrees Vicki Fierheller, a Maltese breeder in Canada. Despite the health problems and other issues, some unethical breeders try to profit from the tiny dogs cuteness and rarity. Some unscrupulous breeders purposely breed for the teacup size because then can sell them for much more money, but many times the wee ones have serious health problems.<br><br>Here at Contented Puppies Paradise we may occasionally have a smaller Maltese or Yorkie. But we do not breed purposely for the teacup size and would highly recommend you consult with your veterinarian before purchasing any teacup puppy.</p>

            <p><strong>I know from experience that it is easy to put instructions away with the best of intentions of reading them later. However,</strong>¬†following some of these guidelines may make the difference between life and death for your puppy. So please take the time to carefully read all the following instructions.¬†</p>
            <p><strong>Before you read any farther, make sure you realize that a Yorkie is a high maintenance dog!</strong>¬†They require a lot of time, attention, and human interaction! Even my biggest pups are small. The Tinies require extra attention and a close eye on them. I don&#x27;t recommend that you purchase a Yorkie, especially a tiny, if you are away from your home a lot, have small children, or if you don&#x27;t plan on making it part of your family. I beg you to do some research on the breed. This is just a condensed guide, not an entire manual.¬†</p>
            <h3>Choking Hazards</h3>
            <p><strong>They choke, they choke, they choke!</strong>¬†When giving your puppy food, snacks, or maybe even a forbidden tidbit from the table, always remember how small their throats are. Unlike most dogs, they can get the smallest things caught in their throats. Cut up everything you give them into very small pieces! Be especially careful when they are puppies and continue using caution throughout their lifetime. Not only are their throats small, adding to the problem is the fact that the smaller dogs also have trouble chewing something big.¬†</p>
            <h3>Dog Food</h3>
            <p><strong>We use and highly recommend Life&#x27;s Abundance Dog Food.</strong>¬†We have tried some of the highly recommended dog foods like Royal Canin and have had our disappointments. Some times it was old and moldy right off the shelf. Also they have had recalls which makes us very uneasy about these large companies. After lots and lots of research, we are thrilled with Life&#x27;s Abundance.<strong>Their food is no older than 4-6 weeks when you purchase it</strong>¬†and the results in your pets are amazing. ALL that goes in the dog food is human grade and fresh. Because we are very concerned that our puppies receive only the very best out there, we will guarantee your puppy to be sound and healthy for the first year when you feed Life&#x27;s Abundance to your little one. You can purchase this online at¬†<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lifesabundance.com/Pets/Petshome.aspx?realname=40078053"><strong>www.LifesAbundance.com</strong></a>¬†or you can call us at 352-220-0351. We will be more than happy to help you get the right amount of food ordered for your little one. They will drop it right at your door. Make sure food is available to them at all times. They will eat small amounts throughout the day and night. We also recommend a halter leash instead of a collar due to their small trachea.¬†</p>
            <h3>Low Blood Sugar</h3>
            <p><strong>Yorkies have low blood sugar until they are about 12 weeks old and longer if they are tiny.</strong>¬†Make sure they eat well before they play. If they seem sluggish, shake, act drunk, or even vomit, give them a dime-sized dose of Nutri-Cal or raw honey on their tongue and call me. If they seem to be playing really hard, it will not hurt them to give them a dose. However an overdose is possible so do not exceed a maximum of two doses in one day. Call me immediately if your puppy refuses to eat. (Especially the day your receive your puppy.) Low blood sugar can be deadly if not corrected!¬†</p>
            <h3>Danger Being Stepped On</h3>
            <p><strong>Be alert and aware of where you walk or sit at all times.</strong>¬†You will soon learn to scoot your feet when you walk, and always watch where you step. They will run under your feet until they figure out it might be a dangerous practice. The other thing I noticed with all my dogs is they will jump on the couch or chair and look up at me lovingly. When I move them over so I can sit next to them and as I turn to sit, they jump under me and may end up getting sat on. The best thing to do is hold them as you are in the process of sitting down until they learn to get out of the way. Remember to use extra caution whenever you sit and never leave a puppy alone with children.¬†</p>
            <h3>Outside Dangers</h3>
            <p><strong>Many Yorkies, (even 12 Lb. ones), have been known to meet their demise by outside dangers.</strong>¬†Some of their common enemies are larger dogs, hawks, owls and coyotes. These have been known to carry them off. Therefore it is vital that you use extreme caution when your dog is outside. Also keep in mind that they can fall prey to human abduction. It has been reported that one new owner had her puppy stolen while paying for gas! Be on your guard at all times and take the proper precaution to keep your little one from such an undesirable fate.¬†</p>
            <h3>Coat Management</h3>
            <p><strong>Yorkies are capable of possessing that gorgeous, long hair look.</strong>¬†It does take a lot of work to keep them beautiful. Even if you decide to keep their coats long, you need to make sure you keep their buttocks clipped short. The hair tends to get in the way when they go potty, and a build-up may prevent them from being able to go potty. If the problem is not corrected immediately this can become serious. Even as your little one matures into an adult you need to make sure the buttock area is not becoming matted.¬†</p>
            <h3>Baby Teeth Troubles</h3>
            <p><strong>When your puppy is 6-8 months old you need to start checking them to make sure no adult teeth are growing beside a baby puppy tooth.</strong>¬†It is very common for them to have difficulty losing their puppy teeth. A trip to the vet is warranted for some tooth pulling. Females should be spayed before they are 9 months old, males neutered as young as your vet recommends. If this is not done they will mark territories when older.¬†</p>
            <h3>Ears &quot;Standing On End&quot;</h3>
            <p><strong>Your puppy&#x27;s ears will go up and down as they go through the teething process.</strong>¬†But their ears should be up after they are a few months old. If they fold down in half some taping may become necessary.¬†</p>
            <h3>Sensitive Puppy</h3>
            <p><strong>Yorkies are very sensitive to your moods! They just melt if they think you are angry with them.</strong>¬†If you are angry be sure to let them know that you still love them even if they did do something naughty. Never hit or kick them. A firm &quot;No&quot; is usually sufficient. They will run to you if they are in trouble just to get some reassurance that you will help them. Chaos in the house will make them shiver with fear, a trip to the vet and any other unfamiliar circumstance will have the same effect. So be sure to let them know everything is fine when they are afraid. And remember, they will always need lots of love and attention.¬†</p>
            <h3>Activity Levels</h3>
            <p><strong>Yorkies are known to be very active. This is especially noticeable up to about 10 months of age.</strong>¬†They are very athletic and love to run. They settle down to be quite the lap dog as adults. Yorkies also like to chew. I buy toddler teething toys, (without water), for them to chew even as adults. The size is perfect and they love that rattle sound most of them have. A word of caution, keep all paper out of reach. Puppies are by far the worst, but even adults love to chew that magazine or phone book. You are free to contact me at any time in the event that you have questions or concerns you feel I may be able to resolve.</p>

            <p><strong>Here, at Contented Puppies, we are committed to obtaining optimal health both in our puppies and our adult dogs.</strong>¬†Over the years, we have been disappointed in some of the most highly recommended dog foods on the market today. We have done a tremendous amount of research and have been appalled at the poor quality in most dog foods currently on the market. There are ingredients in these dog foods that you would never knowingly feed your beloved pet. There have been many recalls on dog food that vets and AKC still highly recommend. We are simply not willing to risk the life or health of our beautiful dogs and puppies by feeding contaminated dog food.¬†<strong>Life&#x27;s Abundance has never had a single recall,</strong>¬†and they have been in business for a decade.</p>
            <p><strong>We are so excited to find a company that actually exceeds what we hoped to find.</strong>¬†Life&#x27;s Abundance is formulated by a holistic veterinarian who works on the cutting edge of science and uses all natural, holistic, human grade ingredients to formulate a perfectly balanced food for our pets. Life&#x27;s Abundance dog food is never found on the shelves of pet stores, as they guarantee the food to be fresh, never more than 4-6 weeks from the time it is manufactured to the moment it is dropped at your door. Did you know that most dog food sits on the shelf, or in the warehouse, for up to two years before you purchase it for your dog? Please check out their website at¬†<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lifesabundance.com/Pets/Petshome.aspx?realname=40078053/"><strong>www.LifesAbundance.com</strong></a>¬†and do your own research. You may be shocked to find out the truth about some major dog food chains on the market today.</p>
            <p><strong>We also really like their shampoo and training treats.</strong>¬†All their products are great, but we use mostly these three. Small dogs like Yorkshire Terriers and Maltese need a very mild shampoo that will not dry out their coat. Life&#x27;s Abundance shampoo has a very pleasing scent, and it stays on for days. The treats are wholesome and very nutritious as well. While providing the very best treats and training treats on the market, as well as other pet care products, tasty rewards are incredible for training as they are made from free range chicken, venison, and pumpkinseed for the brain!¬†<strong>No contaminations!</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Lastly, you may be wondering, &quot;Can I afford this for my beloved dog?&quot;</strong>¬†My question is, &quot;Can I afford not to feed the very best to my dog?&quot; With the cost of a visit to the vet at an all time high, you can be sure that you will save when you invest in great food for your dog. We have been feeding Life&#x27;s Abundance to our dogs for almost a year now, and have been amazed at the performance of our moms and dads. Most of all in the health of our puppies. Yorkie puppies are very tiny when they are born and need lots of tender care, but we are amazed at the stamina and vigor of our babies from the moment they are born, which we never had before. If you are a breeder, or are considering the idea, good nutrition is a must! If you try this food, we guarantee you will never go back to the commercial dog food again.</p>
            <p><strong>We estimate it costs $10 a month to feed a small dog,</strong>¬†which includes the shipping. When you order, be sure to go on their autoship program to get an even better deal. Also, order everything you will need for two months, and this will save on your shipping. An 8 lb bag is plenty to feed a small Yorkie or Maltese for two months. You can change your shipping times to a time that is convenient for you by calling their office. Many people call me and want to know why there is only one dog food and why there is no puppy food. Life&#x27;s Abundace makes one wholesome, nutrition packed food for dogs of all ages, so if you have an older dog at home, they can all eat the same food.</p>
